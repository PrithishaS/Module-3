# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
# Reg.No: 212222210020
# Name: Prithisha S

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
temp = num
rev = 0

while num > 0:
    digit = num % 10
    rev = rev * 10 + digit
    num = num // 10

if temp == rev:
    print("Palindrome Number")
else:
    print("Not a Palindrome")

## Output
Enter a number: 121
Palindrome Number

## Result
The programs were implemented successfully and the outputs were verified.
